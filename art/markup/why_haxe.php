                    <h3>One Language, Everywhere</h3>

                    <p> Haxe is an unique high level programming language - similar to
                        Java/C#/PHP/AS3 - that has been designed to compile to multiple platforms. Unlike other
                        technologies, Haxe does not have its own private platform or virtual machine : it will be
                        compiled natively to every supported platforms, with almost-zero overhead. This allows Haxe
                        to access the full platform capabilities, and not only a restricted subset.</p>

                        all your code strictly-typed.</p>

                        efficient graphics engine to the Haxe capabilities. The particularity of Haxe is that you
                        can still access each individual device specific features : write once, then customize for
                        your most important devices.</p>

                        technologies such as PHP, NodeJS, Java, C# and NekoVM. By using an unified client-server
                        language,
                        you are saving a lot of time and helping your team overall communication.</p>
