                        for an existing Haxe Foundation supported project, you can offer a bounty for it!</p>

                    <p>We will publish your bounty to make sure people know about it
                        We will help you to get in touch with the best engineers to get the job done!
                        When completed, you will be listed in the companies contributing to Haxe
                        Please note that the Bounty program only apply to features that are not ultra-specialized for
                        your own usage, and which will be open sourced after they are completed. For tailor-made
                        closed-source engineering, please contact us so we can find someone for you.</p>
