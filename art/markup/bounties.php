                        When completed, you will be listed in the companies contributing to Haxe
                        Please note that the Bounty program only apply to features that are not ultra-specialized for
                        your own usage, and which will be open sourced after they are completed. For tailor-made
                        closed-source engineering, please contact us so we can find someone for you.</p>
